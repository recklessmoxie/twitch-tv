## Twitch Tv: A Free Code Camp Project

### Objective:

* Use the Twitchtv JSON API

* Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to <a href="https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/"> this. <a/>

<ol>
<li>Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.</li>

<li>Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li> User Story: I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.<li>

<li> User Story: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.</li>

<li> User Story: if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming. </li>

<li> User Story: I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.</li>
</ul>
